						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>
							During the first edition of
							<a href="https://www.framer.com/loupe/">Loupe</a>, I build my
							first prototype with Framer X. This was for me the opportunity to
							dust off my front-end skills, with the introduction of React in
							Framer.

						<h3>Designing with data</h3>
						<p>
							The goal of this project was to design and prototype a simple app
							that relies on real time data for its core feature.<br />
							For the past few years I designed mostly with regular UI design
							tools (Sketch & Figma) and while they are great for building
							functional, beautiful UI, they don't lend themselves well to a use
							case where you'd need the ability to interact with real time data.
							It's possible to integrate data based on research/intuitions but
							there might be a chance your dataset doesn’t cover all use
							cases.<br />
							For this project, accurate data was important but the real-time
							aspect was what makes the prototype powerful, because it provides
							up-to-date information to the user.

					></module>
					<article>
						<p>
							It doesn't rain a lot in San Francisco but during my time in
							Amsterdam the weather was cloudy and having precise information
							about precipitations was useful.<br />
							Data is provided by a geolocation service and Dark Sky, a service
							that provides forecast data. Their API provides very detailed
							predictions for precipitation numbers throughout the day. Being
							able to inject accurate and precise data allowed me to iterate
							quickly and experiment with different UI concepts.

						<h3>Designing with code</h3>
						<p>
							The biggest challenge of this project was to transition from
							Framer Classic to Framer X. Tools (from my experience in
							photography and design) should help constrain your tendencies but
							never get in the way of creativity.<br />
							Framer X still feels a bit restrictive as a UI Design tool but
							truly shines when it comes to building high fidelity prototypes.
							There wasn’t a lot of documentation available when I worked on
							this but the Framer team has been really focused on providing
							resources that explain the core concepts of React and that allow
							designers to get started quickly without feeling intimidated.

						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							This project allowed me to design with a different approach. The
							experience was refreshing because it forced me to revisit my
							process.<br />
							I released the project on GitHub to provide resources for the
							design community, to help other designers get started with Framer
							X. Since then new best practices have slighty changed so it’s
							probably not the cleanest code but the base logic can still be
							re-used and applied to other use cases.
