						<h4>Context</h4>
						<p>
							Front is a communication platform for teams helping
							customer-facing teams better interact with their customers across
							a variety of external communication tools
						</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							Front for iOS is the ideal companion to triage and reply to emails
							when you are on the go. With more and more Front users relying on
							it, we decided to revisit the composing experience. For this
							project, we focused on context and speed when replying to
							conversations.<br /><br />
							Users were not able to get the full context of a conversation
							while replying to a message, increasing the time it took to reply
							and lowering the quality of the replies.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br />
							I worked closely with the iOS engineering team throughout the
							entire design progress, from the early ideation stage to the final
							implementation reviews.

						<h3>Replying with context</h3>
						<p>
							Replying to a message can be straightforward, but sometimes it
							requires more effort.<br />
							That’s why having access to the full history of a conversation can
							be helpful in a lot of situations. In Front, earlier messages,
							comments, and activities may all contain pertinent context. It
							became apparent that a user would need to read the conversation
							while composing a reply.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<p>
							In the previous iteration, users had to follow a linear flow in
							order to reply to a message. This created 2 very distinct phases
							during the replying process:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li
								>A "consuming" phase, that allowed the user to understand the
								full context of a conversation and its content.
							</li>
							<li
								>A "replying" phase during which the user focuses on composing
								their message.
							</li>
						</ul>

						href="src/modules/project-image.html"
						locals='{"url":"./assets/images/projects/front/reply-drawing-1.png", "caption":false}'
					></module>
					<article>
						<p>
							During the research phase, we realized how a lot of users had to
							navigate between the two screens in order to compose their reply,
							especially when confronted with:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li
								>Long conversations containing information spread out across
								multiple messages.
							</li>
							<li
								>Conversations with precise and detailed information needed by
								the user to compose a reply.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</article>

						href="src/modules/project-image.html"
						locals='{"url":"./assets/images/projects/front/reply-drawing-2.png", "caption":false}'
					></module>
					<article>
						<p>
							Research also allowed us to highlight friction points users were
							facing during the reply experience.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li
								>The navigation between the different screens was increasing the
								cognitive load of the user.
							</li>
							<li
								>Switching screens also required multiple user interactions in
								various UI components.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<article>
						<h3>Early explorations</h3>
						<p>
							Based on the learnings for the research phase, we decided to focus
							on a fluid experience. <br />The new experience would need to
							reduce navigation transitions between screens and limit the number
							of user interactions needed to switch between the conversation and
							the composer.
						</p>

						locals='{"url":"./assets/images/projects/front/reply-drawing-4.png", "caption":"Side panel exploration"}'
					></module>
					<article>
						<p>
							Two main explorations were considered at this stage of the
							project: a side panel & a bottom panel.<br />
							Both solutions allow the user to switch between the composer and
							the conversation from a single swipe, making the interaction
							seamless.<br />
							<br />
							During the prototyping phase, we were able to identify key
							elements that allowed us to validate the exploration of the bottom
							bar:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li
								>The vertical motion created by the appearance and disappearance
								of the keyboard didn't feel natural with the left to right
								gesture applied by the user when interacting with the side
								panel.
							</li>
							<li
								>The side panel wasn't able to provide a lot of flexibility in
								terms of size options. The panel had to have a fixed height, as
								opposed of the bottom panel which can offer various heights (as
								described in the following section).
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>A flexible experience</h3>
						<p>
							In addition to our main goal, we took this opportunity to also
							simplify and enhance the composing experience. By removing
							advanced features and focusing on the core experience, we were
							able to provide the right amount of flexibility at the right time
							without overwhelming the user. In order to build this new
							experience we focused on a multi states composer. Instead of
							having a single fullscreen experience for the composer, we decided
							to split it into 3 different states:<br />
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li
								>Collapsed: The content of the draft is not visible. This mode
								is used when the composing experience is paused and the content
								of the conversation is the main element of focus.
							</li>
							<li
								>Adaptive: The composer will be responsive, based on the content
								of the draft. This allows the user to focus both on the content
								of the conversation and the composition of the reply.
							</li>
							<li
								>Expanded: The composer is shown on top of the conversation. It
								can be used for longer drafts.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Multi channels</h3>
						<p
							>While a lot of conversations in the app are emails, Front
							supports a variety of different channel types. Facebook Messenger,
							Twitter, SMS, and others are available. This requires the composer
							to support additional features; providing an optimized experience
							for each channel. The Twitter composer provides a username
							autocomplete as well as a character count. The SMS composer
							displays a character counter. The SMS composer is displaying a SMS
							counter.

					<article>
						<h3>Other explorations</h3>
						<p>
							Some early explorations focused on a mini toolbar that could be
							used to provide more options to the composer. The initial mockups
							focused only on replying with text, and we also explored a small
							system with attachment management.<br />
							We ended up revisiting the signature UI and switched from a
							floating pill to a new action available in the mini toolbar.<br />
							We also designed an attachment viewer with the ability to see file
							name, file sizes and image previews.

					<article>
						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							After the release of this new composer, we measured the adoption
							of the new composer.<br />75% of our users rely on the new quick
							reply mode while 25% prefer to use the fullscreen mode.<br />
							This project was an opportunity for the design team to focus on
							providing a more adaptive experience in the app; allowing the user
							to choose the UI that matches their need, while offering more
							context enabling efficiency.
