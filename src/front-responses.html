            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              Front is a communication platform for teams helping
              customer-facing teams better interact with their customers across
              a variety of external communication tools
            </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Responses are a powerful way of replying to messages in Front. It
              allows users to send saved responses, saving them time, and
              increasing the quality of their replies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usage of responses was low and users found it difficult to find
              and manage their personal and shared responses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />Over a couple of weeks, I worked on the wireframing of
              various explorations, conducted internal feedback sessions where I
              presented low-fidelity prototypes, and iterated on high-fidelity
              designs.

            <h3>Explorations</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the problem definition, we decided to focus on a few key
              areas:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Better organization</li>
              <li>
                Make it easier for users to find the response they are looking
                for
              </li>
              <li>Make it easier for users to make edits to responses</li>
              <li>
                Improve the composing experience and provide more formatting
                options
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <br />As a secondary goal, we also decided to explore a few ideas
              on enhancing the productivity of users with new ways of surfacing
              responses.

            <h4>Modal</h4>
            <p>
              To remove constraints related to the existing solution, we started
              from a blank page and decided to start iterating on a larger UI
              component to improve the functionalities of the response picker.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Relying on a larger UI component to improve the
              functionalities of the response picker.
            </p>
            <p>
              The side navigation allows us to create multiple sections, making
              it easier for users to find the response they are looking for. The
              first section is a short list of the most frequently used
              responses, followed by the personal responses created by the user
              and the list of all the other responses available (categorized by
              team).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This exploration also incorporates some ideas from the Snippet
              exploration (more details below)
            </p>
          </article>
          <module
            href="src/modules/project-image.html"

          ></module>
          <article>
            <p>
              The larger message viewer/editor helps the user to get a full
              preview of the response, and can also surface entry points for
              variable insertion in responses. It also provides all the
              formatting options available in the regular message composer.

            <h4>Message Preview</h4>
            <p>
              While the current implementation is limited in terms of features,
              we decided keep the current dropdown UI as a foundation and
              redesign it. The goal is to reduce the amount of new UI the user
              will need to relearn when we launch this project.

            <h4>Snippets</h4>
            <p>
              During interviews, I noticed how repeating tasks could be avoided
              by providing more advanced solutions to power users. Here the user
              is able to register frequently used responses and insert them
              directly into the message composer. As the user is typing their
              command, Front will try to match it to a corresponding response
              and display a preview of the message.
            </p>

            <h4>Responses suggestions</h4>
            <p>
              Snippets seemed like a good way to speed up the process of
              inserting a response and I wanted to go one step further in that
              direction. I explored a proactive solution that would provide
              recommendations to the user, based on the context of the
              conversation.<br />
              Instead of having to manually pick a response, Front will showcase
              a list of matching responses based on various criteria (emotions,
              topics, previous conversations...)
            </p>

            <h3>Prototypes & Feedback sessions</h3>
            <p>
              I had the opportunity to create a few interactive experiences
              based on the low fidelity explorations. Because of time
              constraints, I didn't have the chance to interview external users
              but I set up a few interviews with teammates from the sales,
              customer success, and support teams at Front.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Based on the feedback I collected, I was able to isolate recurring
              comments:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modal felt too heavy, users preferred the lighter experience of
                the existing dropdown combined with the message preview
              </li>
              <li>
                Users liked the "Frequently used" section in the modal
                experience, as most of them use a limited set of responses
                frequently (especially for the support use case)
              </li>
              <li>
                Being able to organize responses with categories seemed very
                intuitive and convenient (most users use their personal
                responses and responses from their team only)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </article>

          <article>
            <p>
              For the last round of iterations, we explored a concept that
              combined the lightness of the message preview concept and the
              flexibility offered by the modal. This concept is optimized for
              the recurring usage of a limited set of responses and provides an
              improved browsing experience.

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the last feedback session, we decided to focus on the
              updated dropdown and message preview direction. We prioritized the
              lightness of the experience and made improvements to the existing
              solution instead of going with a brand new system (this allowed us
              to limit the scope of the project).

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              Feedback from users was very positive, and they specifically
              mentioned improvements around:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced time to find responses</li>
              <li>
                Reduced usage of the search function, due to the addition of the
                "Recent responses" section
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased confidence when selecting a responses thanks to the
                new preview UI
