						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							As I started shooting film in 2018, I needed a way to share my
							work with others. While Instagram and Flickr are some valid
							options, I wanted to create a more personal experience. It was
							also the opportunity for me to combine my 2 passions: photography
							& design.
						</p>

					></module>

						<h3>Logo and branding</h3>
						<p>
							In order to add some personality to the project, I explored a few
							ideas for branding. The logo is composed of two “f”, the symbol
							used to indicate an aperture value in photography. The background
							showcases a color spectrum with vibrant tones. A subtle noise is
							present to add more texture and represent the grainy aspect of
							film.

						<h3>An optimized experience</h3>
						<p>
							Personal projects are a great opportunity to focus on delight.
							Often, projects in a professional context have to follow tight
							roadmaps and are restricted by technical limitations. Not beholden
							to anyone but myself, I took my time to focus on the initial
							loading experience to set the tone for the website to follow.
							<br />
							By default browsers will try to load images as fast as they can,
							not providing the user with a sense of progress. This is
							especially true here since the browser tries to fetch a large
							number of images on first load.

						locals='{"url":"./assets/images/projects/filmfeed/Exhibition.jpg", "caption":"Light Table at Oakland Museum of California’s Eames exhibit"}'
					></module>
					<article>
						<p>
							The grid view is directly inspired by a light table I discovered
							at the Eames exhibit at the Oakland Museum of California. I found
							it to be a great way to provide a preview of the photos while the
							main feed was loading.

						<h3>A personal photo feed</h3>
						<p>
							This website is a very personal project and I didn’t wanted to
							show too many information that would make the website look complex
							and busy.<br />
							By removing distractions, I wanted to convey the simplicity of
							shooting film with an old camera.<br />
							Simplicity does not have to come at the cost of information; I
							wanted to show the location, film stock, and focal length for each
							of the photos but I made the choice to only showcase them on hover
							(web) / tap (mobile) to keep the interface as clean as possible.

						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							This project allowed me to create a very personal and minimalistic
							experience - It was also for me the opportunity to control the
							full user experience and make every design decision very
							intentional, something that's not possible on traditional social
							media platforms. It also allowed me to improve my rusty front-end
							skills and use some new layout features (CSS Grids).
