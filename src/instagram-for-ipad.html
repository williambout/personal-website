            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              As a regular user of Instagram, I decided to work on an
              unsolicited redesign of their iOS app and focus on the support of
              the iPad. The exercise here was to refine the experience and allow
              the app to take full advantage of the larger display of the
              device.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Stories</h3>
            <p>
              For this part of the app, I thought it would be interesting to
              explore story previews. Displaying a grid of stories allows the
              user to get a quick overview of all the stories available which is
              especially useful when one follows a large number of accounts and
              want to have a better overview of the all content available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each story is displayed in fullscreen in order to allow for a
              fully immersive experience. To factor in technical constraints
              such as photo size and video compression, these would be limited
              to a fixed container size.

            <h3>Feed & Notifications</h3>
            <p>
              The notifications list has been moved to a dropdown menu on the
              right hand side of the navigation bar allowing it to be accessible
              across various screens in the app. I updated the icon to a more
              generic version to cater to a variety of notification types.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike stories, the feed is using a 1 column layout, like on a
              phone. I experimented with a multi-columns layout but it seemed
              better suited for browsing/discovering new content. The goal for
              the feed is to focus on the quality of the content as opposed to
              the quantity. A single column layout offers a better chance to
              grab the users attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Posts are followed by captions and then by actions and comments.

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>
              Instagram's current navigation system isn't optimized for an
              iPad's form factor. Swipe actions don't translate well on a big
              screen such as the iPad's. Discoverability and engagement can also
              improve with highly visible actions. For Stories, I decided to
              separate them from the main homescreen in order to provide two
              dedicated experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>Other explorations</h3>
            <p>
              Instagram introduced Collections a few years ago but they weren't
              very accessible in the app. As a photographer, I realize how
              important inspiration is to form your own sense of ideas, styles,
              and compositions.<br />
              In this exploration, I included Collections as a dedicated tab in
              the navigation of the app in order to facilitate its
              discoverability. I used this opportunity to revisit their design.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to explore how an optimized experience
              could improve Instagram on an iPad. Reliance on iOS's core
              components could lend a structured, slicker interface. It could
              also allow Instagram to expand the functionalities of its app by
              providing new features related to content exploration, inspiration
              and building communities.
