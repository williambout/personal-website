          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            During the first edition of
            <a href="https://www.framer.com/loupe/">Loupe</a>, I build my first
            prototype with Framer X. This was for me the opportunity to dust off
            my front-end skills, with the introduction of React in Framer.

          <h3>Designing with data</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to design and prototype a simple app
            that relies on real time data for it's core feature.<br />
            For the past few years I designed mostly with regular UI design
            tools (Sketch & Figma) and while they are great for building
            functional, beautiful UI, they don't lend themselves well to a use
            case where you'd need the ability to interact with real time data.
            It's possible to integrate data based on research/intuitions but
            there might be a chance your dataset doesn’t cover all use cases.<br />
            For this project, accurate data was important but the real-time
            aspect was what makes the prototype powerful, because it provides
            up-to-date information to the user.

          <p>
            It doesn't rain a lot in San Francisco but during my time in
            Amsterdam the weather was cloudy and having precise information
            about precipitations was useful.<br />
            Data is provided by a geolocation service and Dark Sky, a service
            that provides forecast data. Their API provides very detailed
            predictions for precipitation numbers throughout the day. Being able
            to inject accurate and precise data allowed me to iterate quickly
            and experiment with different UI concepts.

          <h3>Designing with code</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge of this project was to transition from Framer
            Classic to Framer X. Tools (from my experience in photography and
            design) should help constrain your tendencies but never get in the
            way of creativity.<br />
            Framer X still feels a bit restrictive as a UI Design tool but truly
            shines when it comes to building high fidelity prototypes. There
            wasn’t a lot of documentation available when I worked on this but
            the Framer team has been really focused on providing resources that
            explain the core concepts of React and that allow designers to get
            started quickly without feeling intimidated.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to design with a different approach. The
            experience was refreshing because it forced me to revisit my
            process.<br />
            I released the project on GitHub to provide ressources for the
            design community, to help other designers get started with Framer X.
            Since then new best practices have appeared so it’s probably not the
            cleanest code but the base logic can still be re-used and applied to
            other use cases.
