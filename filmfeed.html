          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            As I started shooting film in 2018, I needed a way to share my work
            with others. While Instagram and Flickr are some valid options, I
            wanted to create a more personal experience. It was also the
            opportunity for me to combine my 2 passions: photography & design.

          <h3>Logo and branding</h3>
          <p>
            In order to add some personality to the project, I explored a few
            ideas for branding. The logo is composed of two “f”, the symbol used
            to indicate an aperture value in photography.<br />
            The background represent a color spectrum with vibrant tones. A
            subtle noise is present to add more texture and bring the grainy
            aspect of film.

          <h3>An optimized experience</h3>
          <p>
            Personal projects are a great opportunity to focus on delight. Often,
            design project in a professional context have to follow tight
            roadmaps and are restricted by technical limitations. Here, I was
            able to spend as much time as I wanted and implement by myself the
            designs. Because of this, it became clear I had to focus on the
            initial loading experience.<br />
            By default browsers will try to load images as fast as they can, not
            providing the user a sens of progress. This is especially the case
            here because the website is trying to fetch all the images when a
            user goes on the website.

          <p>
            The grid view is directly inspired by a light table I discovered at
            the Eames exhibit at the Oakland Museum of California. I found it
            was a great way to provide a preview of the photos while the main
            feed of the website is loading.

          <h3>A personal photo feed</h3>
          <p>
            One of the main constrain I set to myself was simplicity.<br />
            This website is a very personal project antI didn’t wanted to show
            too many information that would make the website look complex and
            generic.<br />
            By removing distractions, I wanted to recreate the simplicity of
            shooting film with an old camera with very few feature.<br />
            I still wanted to provide information for each photos. It’s a way to
            document locations and allow curious people to know which focal
            length and film was used. In order to reveal those information, the
            user need to hover (on desktop) or tap (on mobile) a specific photo.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to create a very personal and minimalist
            experience.<br />
            In the era of social media, it felt refreshing to be able to control
            the end user experience from start to finish.<br />
            It also allowed me to improve my rusty front-end skill and use some
            new layout features (CSS Grids) that are now available in most
            browsers.
