        <h1>FilmFeed</h1>
        <p>
          As I started shooting film in 2018, I needed a way to share my work
          with others. While Instagram and Flickr are some valid options, I
          wanted to create a more personal experience. It was also the
          opportunity for me to combine my 2 passions: photography & design.

        <h2>Logo and branding</h2>
        <p>
          The logo is composed of 2 keys elements: The background is a grainy 3
          colors gradient, made of a warm yellow, a vivid red and a cool blue.
          The combinaison creates a spectrum of colors, while the grain provides
          some texture on top. The logo uses the initials of FilmFeed and is a
          reference to the URL of the website. It is made of 2 Fs that represent
          the aperture number in photography.

        <h2>Approche</h2>
        <p>
          For this personal project, I wanted it to reflect the experience of
          shooting film as much as possible. Simplicity and focus are two of its
          main components. During the entire design process, I kept asking
          myself if my decisions would align with this approche.
