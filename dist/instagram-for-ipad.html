        <h1>Instagram for iPad</h1>
        <p>
          As a regular user of Instagram, I decided to work on an unsolicited
          redesign of their iOS app that focuses on the support the iPad. The
          exercice here was to refine the experience and allow the app to take
          full advantage of the larger display of the device.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container full-width">
        <img class="full-width" src="/posts.32157eff.png" srcset="/posts.32157eff.png    1440w,/posts@2x.5f3f3db4.png 2880w,/posts@3x.64017d2d.png 4320w" alt="">

        <h2>Stories</h2>
        <p>
          For this part of the app, I thought it would be interesting to explore
          with story previews. Displaying a grid of stories will allow the user
          to get a sneak peak of all the stories available. This is especially
          useful when you follow a large amount of accounts and want to have a
          better overview of the all content available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each story is displayed in fullscreen in order to keep a good
          immersion. Because of technical constraints (photo size, video
          compression), stories are limited to a fixed container container.

        <h2>Feed & Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          The notifications list has been moved to a dropdown menu on the right
          of the navigation bar. This allows the menu to be accessible in most
          screens of the app. The icon has been updated with a more generic icon
          that works for a variety of notification types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike stories, the feed is using a 1 column layout, like on a phone.
          I experimented with a multi-columns layout but it seemed better suited
          for browsing/discovering new content. Having 1 column reduces the
          number of posts displayed in the viewport. It results in a better
          focus on the posts, as the goal here is not to “consume content” but
          rather to offer an experience that allows the content to stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Posts have the possibility to have a caption, displayed right under
          the image and above the post’s actions and comments.
        </p>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
          Instagram’s current navigation system isn’t perfectly suited for the
          iPad. It relies a lot on swipe action which are less user friendly on
          such a large display. While I understand the decision to integrate the
          stories in the main “Home” view (discoverability, engagement...), I
          still think it makes a lot of sens to separate them from the
          traditional feed.
