          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            As a regular user of Instagram, I decided to work on an unsolicited
            redesign of their iOS app optimized for iPad use. The exercise here
            was to refine the experience and allow the app to take full
            advantage of the larger display of the device.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Stories</h3>
          <p>
            For this part of the app, I thought it would be interesting to
            explore story previews. Displaying a grid of stories allows the user
            to get a quick overview of all the stories available which is
            especially useful when one follows a large number of accounts and
            want to have a better overview of the all content available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each story is displayed in fullscreen in order to allow for a fully
            immersive experience. To factor in technical constraints such as
            photo size, video compressions, et cetera, these would be limited to
            a fixed container size.
          </p>

          <h3>Feed & Notifications</h3>
          <p>
            The notifications list has been moved to a dropdown menu on the
            right hand side of the navigation bar allowing it to be accessible
            across various screens in the app. I updated the icon to a more
            generic version to cater to a variety of notification types.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike stories, the feed is using a 1 column layout, like on a
            phone. I experimented with a multi-columns layout but it seemed
            better suited for browsing/discovering new content. The goal for the
            feed is to focus on the quality of the content as opposed to the
            quantity. A single column layout offers a better chance to grab the
            users attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Posts are followed by captions and then by actions and comments.

          <h3>Navigation</h3>
          <p>
            Instagram's current navigation system isn't optimized for an iPad's
            form factor. Swipe actions don't translate well on a big screen such
            as the iPad's. While discoverability, engagement, et cetera improve
            with highly visible actions, I still prefer the idea of having
            navigation elements separated from the traditional feed.

          <h3>Other explorations</h3>
          <p>
            Instagram introduced Collections a few years ago but they weren't
            very accessible in the app. As a photographer, I realize how
            important inspiration is to form your own sense of ideas, styles,
            and compositions. In this exploration, I included Collections as a
            dedicated tab in the navigation of the app in order to facilitate
            its discoverability. I used this opportunity to revisit their
            design.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to explore how an optimized experience could
            improve Instagram on an iPad. Reliance on iOS's core components
            could lend a structured, slicker interface. It could also allow
            Instagram to expand the functionalities of its app by providing new
            features related to content exploration, inspiration and building
            communities.
