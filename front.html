          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            With the increasing number user of Front’s iOS app, we decided to
            rethink the composing experience. For this project, we focused on
            context and speed around replying to conversations.<br />
            User were not able to get the full context of a conversation while
            replying to a message, increasing the reply time and lowering the
            quality of the replies.
          </p>

          <h3>Replying with context</h3>
          <p>
            Replying to a message can be strait-forward, but sometime it requires
            more effort.<br />
            That’s why having access to the full history of a conversation can
            be helpful in a lot of situations. In Front, not only you can be
            looking for information in past messages, but also from activities
            and comments added by your team previously. That’s why it became
            clear to us that the user should be able to compose and browse a
            conversation at the same time.

          <h3>A flexible experience</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to our main goal, we took this opportunity to also
            simplify and enhance the composing experience. By removing advanced
            features and focusing on the core experience, we were able to
            provide the right amount of flexibility at the right time. In order
            to build this new experience we focused on a multi states composer.
            Instead of having a single fullscreen experience for the composer,
            we decided to split it into 3 different states:<br />
            - Collapsed: The content of the reply is not visible. This mode is
            used when the composing experience is paused and the content of the
            conversation is main element of focus.<br />
            - Adaptive: The composer will be responsive, based on the content of
            the reply. This allows the user to focus both on the content of the
            conversation and the composition of the reply.<br />
            - Expanded: The composer is shown above the rest of conversation,
            above its content. It can be used for longer messages.

          <h3>Multi channels</h3>
          <p>
            While a lot of conversations the app are emails, Front supports a
            long list of different channel types. Messenger, Twitter, Twilio and
            others are available. This implies that the composer needs to
            support additional features and provide an optimized experience for
            those different type of channels. The Twitter composer is providing
            user autocomplete as well as a character counter. The Twilio composer
            is displaying a SMS counter.

          <h3>Other explorations</h3>
          <p>
            Some explorations focused on a mini toolbar, used to provide more
            option to the composer. The initial exploration focus only on
            replying with text, and we wanted to incorporate some attachment
            management.<br />
            We ended up revisiting the signature UI and switched from a floating
            pill to a new action available in the mini toolbar.<br />
            We also explored an attachment viewer with the ability to see file
            name, file sizes and image previews.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            After the release of this new composer, we measured the adoption of
            the new composer. 75% of our users rely on the new quick reply mode
            while 25% prefer to use the fullscreen mode.<br />
            This project was also the opportunity for the design team to focus
            on providing more adaptive experiences in the app. By allowing the
            user to make the UI adapts to their need, while offering more
            context for a better productivity.
