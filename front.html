            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Front for iOS is the ideal companion to triage and reply to emails
              when you are on the go. With more and more Front users relying on
              it, we decided to revisit the composing experience. For this
              project, we focused on context and speed when replying to
              conversations.<br />
              Users were not able to get the full context of a conversation
              while replying to a message, increasing the reply time and
              lowering the quality of the replies.

            <h3>Replying with context</h3>
            <p>
              Replying to a message can be straightforward, but sometimes it
              requires more effort.<br />
              That’s why having access to the full history of a conversation can
              be helpful in a lot of situations. In Front, not only can you be
              looking for information in past messages, but also from activities
              and comments added by your teammates. That’s why it became clear
              to us that the user should be able to compose and browse a
              conversation at the same time.

            <h3>A flexible experience</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to our main goal, we took this opportunity to also
              simplify and enhance the composing experience. By removing
              advanced features and focusing on the core experience, we were
              able to provide the right amount of flexibility at the right time.
              In order to build this new experience we focused on a multi states
              composer. Instead of having a single fullscreen experience for the
              composer, we decided to split it into 3 different states:<br />
              • Collapsed: The content of the draft is not visible. This mode is
              used when the composing experience is paused and the content of
              the conversation is the main element of focus.<br />
              • Adaptive: The composer will be responsive, based on the content
              of the draft. This allows the user to focus both on the content of
              the conversation and the composition of the reply.<br />
              • Expanded: The composer is shown on top of the conversation. It
              can be used for longer drafts.

            <h3>Multi channels</h3>
            <p>
              While a lot of conversations in the app are emails, Front supports
              a variety of different channel types. Facebook Messenger, Twitter,
              SMS, and others are available. This requires the composer to
              support additinal features; providing an optimized experience for
              each channel. The Twitter composer provides a username
              autocomplete as well as a character count. The SMS composes
              displays a character counter. The SMS composer is displaying a SMS
              counter.

            <h3>Other explorations</h3>
            <p>
              Some early explorations focused on a mini toolbar that could be
              used to provide more options to the composer. The initial mockups
              focused only on replying with text, and we also explored a small
              system with attachment management.<br />
              We ended up revisiting the signature UI and switched from a
              floating pill to a new action available in the mini toolbar.<br />
              We also designed an attachment viewer with the ability to see file
              name, file sizes and image previews.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              After the release of this new composer, we measured the adoption
              of the new composer. 75% of our users rely on the new quick reply
              mode while 25% prefer to use the fullscreen mode.<br />
              This project was an opportunity for the design team to focus on
              providing a more adaptive experience in the app; allowing the user
              to choose the UI that matches their need, while offering more
              context enabling efficiency.
