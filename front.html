          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Front for iOS is the ideal companion to triage and reply to emails when you are on the go. With more and more Front users relying on it, we decided to revisit the composing experience. For this project, we focused on
            context and speed when replying to conversations.<br />
            Users were not able to get the full context of a conversation while
            replying to a message, increasing the reply time and lowering the
            quality of the replies.
          </p>

          <h3>Replying with context</h3>
          <p>
            Replying to a message can be straightforward, but sometimes it requires
            more effort.<br />
            That’s why having access to the full history of a conversation can
            be helpful in a lot of situations. In Front, not only you can be
            looking for information in past messages, but also from activities
            and comments added by your teammates. That’s why it became
            clear to us that the user should be able to compose and browse a
            conversation at the same time.

          <h3>A flexible experience</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to our main goal, we took this opportunity to also
            simplify and enhance the composing experience. By removing advanced
            features and focusing on the core experience, we were able to
            provide the right amount of flexibility at the right time. In order
            to build this new experience we focused on a multi states composer.
            Instead of having a single fullscreen experience for the composer,
            we decided to split it into 3 different states:<br />
            - Collapsed: The content of the reply is not visible. This mode is
            used when the composing experience is paused and the content of the
            conversation is main element of focus.<br />
            - Adaptive: The composer will be responsive, based on the content of
            the reply. This allows the user to focus both on the content of the
            conversation and the composition of the reply.<br />
            - Expanded: The composer is shown on top of the conversation. It can be used for longer drafts.

          <h3>Multi channels</h3>
          <p>
            While a lot of conversations in the app are emails, Front supports a
            variety of different channel types. Facebook Messenger, Twitter, SMS and
            others are available. This implies that the composer needs to
            support additional features and provide an optimized experience for
            those different type of channels. The Twitter composer is providing
            username autocomplete as well as a character counter. The SMS composer
            is displaying a SMS counter.

          <h3>Other explorations</h3>
          <p>
            Some early explorations focused on a mini toolbar that could be used to provide more
            options to the composer. The initial mockups focused only on
            replying with text, and we also explored a small system with attachment
            management.<br />
            We ended up revisiting the signature UI and switched from a floating
            pill to a new action available in the mini toolbar.<br />
            We also designed an attachment viewer with the ability to see file
            name, file sizes and image previews.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            After the release of this new composer, we measured the adoption of
            the new composer. 75% of our users rely on the new quick reply mode
            while 25% prefer to use the fullscreen mode.<br />
            This project was the opportunity for the design team to focus
            on providing a more adaptive experiences in the app, by allowing the
            user to choose the UI that matches their need, while offering more
            context for a better productivity.
