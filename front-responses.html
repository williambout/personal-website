						<h4>Context</h4>
						<p>Front is a communication platform for teams helping customer-facing teams better interact with their customers across a variety of external communication tools</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							Responses are a powerful way of replying to messages in Front. It allows users to send saved responses, saving them time and increasing the quality of their replies.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>
							Usage of responses was low and users found it difficult to find and manage their personal and shared responses.
						</p>
					</article>

						<h3>Explorations</h3>
						<p>
							Based on the problem definition, we decided to focus on a few key areas:<br />
							<ul>
								<li>Better organization</li>
								<li>Make it easier for users to find the response they are looking for</li>
								<li>Make it easier for users to find the right response</li>
								<li>Improve the creating & editing experience</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</br>
						<p>As a secondary goal, we also decided to explore a few ideas on enhancing the productivity of users with new ways of surfacing responses.</p>
					</article>
					<figure>
						<img data-zoomable srcset="./assets/images/projects/front-responses/Goals.png?nf_resize=fit&w=730 730w, ./assets/images/projects/front-responses/Goals.png?nf_resize=fit&w=1460 1460w" src="./assets/images/projects/front-responses/Goals.png?nf_resize=fit&w=730" />
						<figcaption>Key goals are represented by color overlays are used in the following explorations</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<article>
						<h4>Modal</h4>
						<p>The first direction relies on a larger UI component to improve the functionalities of the response picker.</p>
						<p>The side navigation allows us to create multiple sections, making it easier for users to find the response they are looking for. The first section is a short list of the most frequently used responses, followed by the personal responses created by the user and the list of all the other responses available (categorized by team).</p></br>
						<p>This exploration also incorporates some ideas from the Snippet exploration (more details below)</p>

						<h4>Message Preview</h4>
						<p>This exploration focuses on making improvements to the current implementation. Here the idea is to extend the functionalities while reusing the existing UI components. The goal is to reduce the amount of new UI the user will need to relearn.</p>

						<h4>Snippets</h4>
						<p>This exploration focuses on increasing productivity. The user is able to register frequently used responses and insert them directly into the message composer. As the user is typing their command, Front will try to match it to a corresponding response and display a preview of the message.</p>

						<h4>Responses suggestions</h4>
						<p>As a proof of concept, I decided to explore a proactive solution that would provide recommendations to the user, based on the context of the conversation. Instead of having to manually pick a response, Front will showcase a list of matching responses based on various criteria (emotions, topics, previous conversations...)</p>

						<h3>Prototypes & Feedback sessions</h3>
						<p>I had the opportunity to create a few interactive experiences based on the low fidelity explorations. Because of time constraints, I didn't have the chance to interview external users but I set up a few interviews with teammates from the sales, customer success, and support teams at Front.</p></br>
						<p>Based on the feedback I collected, I was able to isolate recurring comments:
						<ul>
							<li>Modal felt too heavy, users preferred the lighter experience of the previous dropdown combined with the message preview</li>
							<li>Users liked the "Frequently used" section in the modal experience, as most of them use a limited set of responses frequently (especially the case for the support use case)</li>
							<li>Being able to organize responses with categories seemed very intuitive and convenient (most users use their personal responses and responses from their team)</li>
						</ul>

					<article>
						<p>For the last round of iterations, we explored a concept that combined the lightness of the message preview concept and the flexibility offered by the modal. This concept is optimized for the recurring usage of a limited set of responses and provides an improved browsing experience.

						<h3>Final Design</h3>
						<p>Based on the last feedback session, we decided to focus on the updated dropdown and message preview direction. We prioritized the lightness of the experience and made improvements to the previous solution instead of going with a brand new system (this allowed us to limit the scope of the project).</p>

						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>Feedback from users was very positive, and they specifically mentioned improvements around:
						<ul>
							<li>Reduced time to find responses</li>
							<li>Reduced usage of the search function, thanks to the "Recent responses"  section</li>
							<li>Increased confidence when selecting a responses thanks to the new preview UI</li>
						</ul>
